ABOUT ERRORS AND HOW TO SOLVE THEM:
 
 If you encountered error at pyttsx3 or no audio has been madas output try installing 
             pip win pywin32
  
If you encountered error stating "  no module named pyaudio"   and something like detecting these errors, encountered some more errors statement:
  
  For pyaudio installation:
          First install    pip install pipwin
          Then,            pipwin install pyaudio
        
        These errors are encountered at speech recognition part...Make sure you import all this.
        
 If you have any errors after installing these also, then you can feel free to ping me or you can search on google.
